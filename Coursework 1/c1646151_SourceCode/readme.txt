1. First run ArrayGenerator which will create three txt files which contain arrays. 
	- These arrays can be configured by changing the values in the first forloop within this file.

2. Then run the SortingAlgorithms.java program to generate the data.
	- You have to manually change what txt file will be used by changing the 'txtFile' in SortingAlgorithms.java. 
	- You can use either:
		- bestCase.txt
		- worstCase.txt
		- averageCase.txt
 	- Change the 'iterations' varible to change how many times each algorithm should run each single array. The higher the value the more accurate the average run time will be.
